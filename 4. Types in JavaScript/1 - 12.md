## JavaScript Types.

number. string. boolean. undefined. null. symbol. object(array. function...).

undefined is absence of definition. null is no value.

primitive type: a data that only represents a single value.

[built-in object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)

Number. String ...  primitive wrappers(object), enable functions to operate primitive value.

## pass by reference vs pass by value

### pass by value:
```javascript
var a = 5
var b = a
```
primitive types are passed by value, this means copy the a's value and put it into a new memory space for b.

### pass by reference.
pro: save memory. con: unintentionally modified.

- shallow copy 
  - Object.assign
  - spread operator(...)

- deep copy
  - JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) (with bad performance and data loss)
  - [stackoverflow-deep-clone](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=deep+clone)

## Type Coercion
language converting a certain type to another type. weakly typed.

if statement. double equal. some mathematical-like operation...

## Static vs Dynamically Typed

### static
statically typed means when declare a variable. declare its type explicitly.
type checking at compile time

### dynamic
not bound value to a certain type. type checking at run time.
