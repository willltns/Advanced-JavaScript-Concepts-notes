## Call Stack & Memory Heap

#### call stack. (used for function invocation (call). first in, last out)
has limit. keep track of the executing code.

[Understanding the JavaScript call stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)
 
*stack overflow*. recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

#### memory Heap
has limit. memory allocation. store data.


Usually simple variables can be stored on the stack and complex data structures stored in memory heap. It depends on the engine implementation.

Whatever is on top of the call stack is where javascript is running.

##### garbage collector

- **mark** and **sweep** algorithm.

clear memory that do not have any reference or do not point to anything. 

*memory leak*

reach maximum size.

- global variables
- event listeners
- setInterval
- ...

## Single Threaded.
Only one set of instruction is executed at a time. only one call stack.

## JavaScript Runtime
The Web API comes with browsers, all of them have their JavaScript Engine implementation and all of them have a Javascript Runtime that provide a Web API(*http request. listen dom event. delay execution...*). perform these operations in the background. asynchronous

#### Event Loop
check if the Call Stack is empty or the Callback Queue has something returned from Web API.

#### Callback Queue
a place for finished Web API operations. waiting for the call stack to be empty and event loop to transfer.
