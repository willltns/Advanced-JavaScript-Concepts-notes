## Inheritance vs Composition

### Inheritance
a superclass that is extended to smaller peices that add or overwrite things.

what it is.

###### drawbacks:
- tightly coupled.rippling effects.
- fragile base class.
- hierarchy

### Composition 
small pieces that are combined to create something bigger.

what it does.

## Programming Paradigm
writing code compliant with a specific set of rules.

### Object-Oriented Programming
organizing code into units, an unit containing information and operations(methods).

- few operations on common data
- stateful
- side effects
- imperative

##### pillars
- abstraction
- encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism

### Functional Programming
Avoiding side effects and writing pure functions. a combination of functions, data is immutable.

- many operations on fixed data
- stateless
- pure
- declarative

##### pillars
- Pure Function*
- HOC
