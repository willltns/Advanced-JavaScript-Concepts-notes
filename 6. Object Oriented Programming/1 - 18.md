# Programming Paradigm
- clear and understandable
- easy to extend
- easy to maintain
- memory efficient
- dry

enable us to make complex code more organized.

Scheme(function) + Java(object) ==> JavaScript

## Object-Oriented Programming
Bringing together the data and its behavior in a single location. modeling real world objects and relationships.

1. copy and paste obj code --> 2. function factory --> 3. OOP

#### `Object.create()`

#### Constructor Function
`new` keyword

#### Prototypal-Based Programming & Class-Based Programming(syntactic sugar)
prototype. `class` keyword.

##### `public` & `private(`#`)` - in staging(2019-07-28)

##### review `this` keyword:
- `new` binding
- implicit binding. inside obj.
- explicit binding. `bind`. `call`. `apply`
- arrow function. lexical binding.

### Inheritance
`extend` keyword. 

```javascript
class B extends A {}

B.prototype.__proto__ === A.prototype

A.prototype.isPrototypeOf(B.prototype)
```

### Four Pillars of OOP:
- Encapsulation.
wrap things are related.

- Abstraction.
hiding the complexity and creating simple interface.

- Inheritance.
avoid repetitive code, memory effeciency.

- Polymorphism. the ability in programming to present the same programming interface for differing underlying forms.
