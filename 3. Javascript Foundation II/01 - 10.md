## Execution Context

##### creation phase
- global execution context (base).  -> `Global Object`. `this`
- function execution context. -> `this`. `arguments`.
- hoisting

##### execution phase
execute code.

Each execution context has its own varialble environment.

## hoisting
JavaScript Engine allocating memory for the variables and functions during the execution context creation phase.

`var` are partially hoisted. `function` are fully hoisted.

`let` and `const` still hoist but cannot access them before the actual declaration is evaluated at runtime.

```javascript
function a() {
	console.log('hello')
}

a() // ?

function a() {
	console.log('bye bye')
}
```

## Function Invocation/Call/Execution
function expression and function declaration. function expression cannot be hoisted.

## Lexical Environment
at compile time, where the code is writter and its location.

global lexical environment.

###### Every time we have a new function, it creates a new world for us.

In JavaScript our <u>lexical scope</u>(available data + variables where the function was defined) determines our available variables. Not where the function is called(dynamic scope)
